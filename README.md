# Hi, I’m Toni (Caffeine Overflow)

I’m a bioinformatics enthusiast with a passion for genomics, transcriptomics, and computational biology. I enjoy turning complex biological data into meaningful insights and building tools that make research easier and more reproducible. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me experimenting with new analysis pipelines or exploring the latest in computational biology.

## Projects

### [DNA Sequence Analyzer](https://github.com/caffeineoverfl/DNASequenceAnalyzer)
A Java toolkit I built for DNA sequence analysis. It can handle transcription and translation, making it easier to explore and understand genetic sequences.

### [DNA Translator Web App](https://github.com/caffeineoverfl/dna-translator-webapp)
A web app I created to translate DNA sequences into mRNA and protein. I wanted a tool that was simple and user-friendly while still powerful.

### Future Projects
I’m planning to dive into more advanced bioinformatics work, including:
- **RNA-Seq Analysis Pipeline:** Automate quality control, alignment, and differential expression analysis.  
- **Variant Annotation Toolkit:** Parse and annotate VCF files, with interactive visualizations.  
- **Genomic Data Dashboard:** Build dashboards for genome assembly metrics and expression data.  
- **Machine Learning for Genomics:** Explore predictions of gene expression patterns or functional effects of variants.
