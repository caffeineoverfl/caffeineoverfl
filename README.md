# Hi, I’m Toni (Caffeine Overflow)

I’m a bioinformatics enthusiast with a passion for genomics, transcriptomics, and computational biology. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me experimenting with new analysis pipelines or exploring the latest in computational biology.

## Projects

### [DNA Sequence Analyzer](https://github.com/caffeineoverfl/DNASequenceAnalyzer)
A Java toolkit I built for DNA sequence analysis. It can handle transcription and translation, making it easier to explore and understand genetic sequences.

### [DNA Translator Web App](https://github.com/caffeineoverfl/dna-translator-webapp)
A web app I created to translate DNA sequences into mRNA and protein. I wanted a tool that was simple and user-friendly while still powerful.
